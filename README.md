# RaspberryPi-RemoteControl-For-LGOled-TV
This project aims to improve LG OLED TV remote control by using a Raspberry Pi as a receiver for any Bluetooth device and transmitting the signal to the TV via an IR emitter. This allows the use of any Bluetooth controller.

Additionally, a arduino version is being developed to transform IR signals from other manufacturers into an LG OLED-compatible signal.
